        <h1>Complex Poem</h1>
        <div class="poem">
In the labyrinth of love and strife we've tread,
A complex tale of emotions left unsaid.
I'll endeavor to explore this story's depths,
With intricacies and nuances that love accepts.

The farewell night, it shrouded us in gloom,
Expressions masked, like a pending monsoon.
You used to say, "You're my guiding light,"
But now you claim, "It's my life, let's end this fight."

I yearned to smile and send you on your way,
Yet, the ache inside begged me to stay.
The battle we had, it spanned a full day,
At least inquire how I fared in every way.

On that day, my results, like lead, did weigh,
I strived to finish projects and exam array.
You posed the questions, so crucial and demanding,
About why we must wed, where you're standing.

One admission, one result, by luck's embrace,
Can transform a soul, change their life's pace.
I hadn't fathomed such dreams before,
But I trusted you with everything, that's for sure.

You mentioned your family's doubts, unsure,
Of your chosen path, or where it'd secure.
UPSC could be the way, a new dream unfurled,
I adapted, I changed, my life in a whirl.

Yet, you remained stagnant, a fixed point in time,
Never considering my journey or rhyme.
You returned to the "boys" talk, your beloved theme,
In every altercation, an unwelcome stream.

I thought we'd progressed, left those days behind,
But here it is again, rearing its head, unrefined.
You asked why I'd been with you from the start,
If you wished to pursue your path, and depart.

The "boys" theme, it started the discordant sound,
Our relationship's melody, so often unwound.
I insisted, "If this is what you need, please leave,"
But here we stand, unable to retrieve.

After joining IIT, it was all a clever ruse,
A facade to conceal what's true and confuse.
You spoke of expectations, a heavy weight to bear,
But did I ever hold back, or leave things in the air?

In our words, we once called ourselves "soulmates,"
A singular piece, together, we'd navigate.
From day to night, I'd lull you to sleep,
But somewhere, our promises began to seep.

You'd say, "I'm coming to Chandigarh, we'll see,"
Made countless promises, now lost at sea.
We'd decided to meet your parents, you and I,
You claimed you'd manage it all, that was your reply.

Despite the hope, it all unraveled, oh so fast,
You said, "Let me live my life," a die was cast.
I can't exist, can't fathom the thought of living,
Without you, the one whom my heart was giving.

You recall our sensitive past, as we go back,
But here we are again, it's the "boys" you unpack.
How casually you address it, as if unaware,
Of the pain it causes, the love that's now threadbare.

You mention a lady, societal thoughts so low,
Freedom, they say, is the way to go.
If you wished to explore such a world, you see,
Why include me in a dance that wasn't meant to be?

I'm a person who hardly spoke, you'd agree,
Back in school, you and I, we barely did foresee,
But even after parting, I stayed near your side,
We met, kindled something eternal, can't hide.

As we grew closer, you explored your desires wide,
But I can't comprehend why you'd want to hide.
If you loved me, you'd know I needed you, so clear,
Yet, when I spoke out, you'd turn a deaf ear.

You said countless things, I listened with care,
But when I shared my thoughts, it's more than you'd bear.
"Hey, don't be insecure," you'd briskly retort,
But what about me, am I not part of your fort?

Whenever you needed "Ashu," I'd be there,
But when I required you, conditions you'd ensnare.
At home, it was all about "us," and our bond so tight,
But somewhere, that love transformed, took flight.

After facing a depression, so dire and grave,
I thought we'd overcome, our love to save.
But your language with me, it twisted and bent,
From "we" to "mine," it left me discontent.

When you were with me, I was your everything,
The person you'd cherish, to whom you'd sing.
And now, you ask why I didn't smile that night,
As you left for your farewell, ending our fight.

It wasn't a fight, just a word and a glance,
Yet, you continue to dance in that "boys" trance.
No one else in the world would doubt on you, I fear,
How did you manage to say that to your sister, dear?

Even in view of our past, how deep and sincere,
I wonder how I'll prove my intentions, so clear.
Our arguments revolved around what was right,
But now, it's the "boys" that's in your limelight.

You said countless times, "If you want to go, then leave,"
But here we stand, you and me, a love's pet peeve.
I can't imagine a life without you, it's true,
But after results and a Ph.D., I've a different view.

Now I'm content, or maybe I've evolved,
No longer a piece of the puzzle to be solved.
I did all I could to take care of you, so grand,
In your health, your dreams, in the study of your land.

I was there from the start, in every way,
But it's all about you now, in the light of the day.
I pondered your attachments, your intent so bold,
Was it all a game, a story left untold?

We had a fight where parents would intrude,
Was it a plan to ignore me, and our love misconstrued?
You changed your status, neglected me in the fray,
But it's not over until I win, I must convey.

While I waited for a response, so delayed,
I'd fight for you with "Ma," but no disrespect displayed.
I'd said countless times, "I'll take it on me, don't you see?"
But you ignored "Ma," said your actions were right, carefree.

You questioned the need for marriage, to unite,
Saying, "I'm fine as I am," in the dimming light.
What's the need to be together, you'd declare,
I'm not fine with this, and it's a cross to bear.

Once more, you're entangled in that "boys" theme,
I can't change your mind, it's like a never-ending dream.
You're marked by "low thinking," before results, it seems,
"Quickly do your UPSC," you'd say, in your streams.

At home, you'd teach online, and research your delight,
Planning for adoption, dreams of family so bright.
Your pay would go to that family, you'd avow,
But the results arrived, and you have a different vow.

You'd compare me to your father, an endless refrain,
"He's your father," you'd say, causing me pain.
I am who I am, I did all I could,
What's left, I'm unsure, but it's understood.

You're still fixated on "boys," it's your song,
From the start to the end, it's what you prolong.
You lied to your sister, a well-orchestrated scheme,
Telling her about me, disrupting our dream.

On our last day, you were physically involved with me,
A connection we shared, but now it's history.
You've forgotten your doubts, the times we'd plea,
How many times we were physical, you'd agree.

What kind of person have you become, I wonder,
To use me, emotionally, physically, like thunder.
You've played your game well, but at what cost?
Karma will reveal what's truly lost.

Now, as we conclude this convoluted ride,
I hope you find peace on the other side.
Our love may be fragmented, but the memories persist,
In this bittersweet farewell, I'll persist to coexist.

There's more to this tale, a chapter untold,
But for now, let's bid our emotions unfold.
In this complex love story, there's much to explore,
A journey of highs and lows, of that, I am sure.
