    <pre>
        In the labyrinth of our love once so bright,
        Now cast in shadows, we traverse the night.
        
        That farewell night, you left me in despair,
        No smiles, just a cold, icy stare.
        You used to say, "You are my life,"
        that night , "its my life," causing strife.
        
        I wanted to smile and bid you goodbye,
        But the pain in my heart made me shy.
        A fight, we called it, or so I believed,
        It was more of your words, you wouldn't be deceived.
    
        Buried in projects, exams in a row.
        Suddenly, you questioned our need to marry,
        "Why be together? U can live like that" you pondered, and my heart bled.
        To hear you say these things, to drift apart.
        
        One admission, one result, by luck's embrace,
        Can transform a soul, change their life's pace.
        I hadn't thought such dreams before,
        But I trusted you with everything, that's for sure.
        
        You mentioned your family's doubts, unsure,
        Of my chosen path, or where it'd secure.
        UPSC could be the way, a new dream unfurled,
        I adapted, I changed, my life in a whirl.
        
        Yet, you remained stagnant, a fixed point in time,
        Never considering my journey or rhyme.
        Got offers to US and Bangalore, I denied as to stay with you.
        And you say u can live like this, its fine, never gave a thought about me and about our dreams.
        
        "Why were you with me?" I asked in despair,
        If this was your plan, it's only fair.
        To be open and free when you wished,
        Leaving me lost and bitterly squished.
        
        The "boys" theme, it started the discordant sound,
        In our conflicts, like an unending dream.
        I insisted, "If this is what you need, please leave,"
        But u said sorry, cant live without you.
        
        On our last day at home, you were physically involved with me all knew with that bite,
        A connection we shared, but now it's history.
        then how you've forgotten your doubts, at those times,
        How many times we were physical, you'd agree for years, hundred of times.
        Where were your doubts then, what about your lady respect?
        
        Expectations, you say, but what haven't I shared?
        Our love was once a bond, a connection so rare when you were at home.
        I was there for you, from dawn 'til nightfall,
        But now it's all you, my voice in your ear.
        
        In our words, we once called ourselves "soulmates,"
        A single piece, together, we'd navigate.
        From day to night, I'd lull you to sleep,
        But coming here, your promises began to seep.
        
        You'd say, "I'm coming to Chandigarh, we'll see, do this, that,"
        Made countless promises, now lost at sea.
        We'd decided to meet my parents, you and I,
        You claimed you'll handle it all, that was your reply.
        But your actions, caused pain and a drought.
        
        Despite the hope, it all unraveled, oh so fast,
        You said, "Let me live my life," a die was cast.
        I can't exist, can't fathom the thought of living,
        Without you, the one whom my heart was giving.
        
        You recall our sensitive past, as we go back,
        But here we are again, it's the "boys" you unpack.
        How casually you address it, as if unaware,
        Of the pain it causes, the love that's now threadbare.
        
        You mention like lady, societal thoughts so low,
        Freedom, u say, is the way to go.
        If you wished to explore such a world, you see,
        Why included me in a dance that wasn't meant to be?
        
        I'm a person who hardly spoke, you'd agree,
        Back in school, you and I, we barely did foresee,
        But even after parting way, I stayed near your side,
        We met again, made something eternal, special.
        
        As we grew closer, you explored your desires wide,
        But I can't comprehend why you'd want to hide.
        If you loved me, you'd know I needed you, so clear,
        Yet, when I spoke out, you'd turn a deaf ear.
        
        You said countless things, I listened with care,
        But when I shared my thoughts, it's more than you'd bear.
        "Hey, don't be insecure, low thinking, if i will think of you how will i live" you'd briskly retort,
        But what about me, am I not part of your fort?
        
        Whenever you needed "Ashu," I'd be there,
        But when I required you, conditions you'd ensnare.
        At home, it was all about "us," and our bond so tight,
        But somewhere, that love transformed, took flight.
        
        After facing a depression, so dire and grave,
        I thought we'd overcome, our love to save.
        But your language with me, it twisted and bent,
        From "we, us" to "me and mine," it left me discontent.
        
        When you were with me, I was your everything,
        The person you'd cherish, to whom you'd sing.
        And at cu, you ask why I didn't smile that night,
        As you left for your farewell, beacuse u said 'its my life'.
        
        It wasn't a fight, just a word and a glance,
        Yet, you continue to dance in that "boys" trance.
        No one else in the world would doubt on me about you, I fear,
        How did you manage to say that to your sister, dear?
        
        Even in view of our past, how deep and sincere,
        I wonder how I'll prove my intentions, so clear.
        Our arguments revolved around what was right in a relation, you took it wrong not me.
        
        I said countless times, "If you want to do these stuff, then leave, not good for us"
        But here you stood, Cant live without you.
        You can't imagine a life without me, it's true,
        But after result and a Ph.D., You've a different view.
        
        I cared for you,your health, your dreams, and everything possible,
        Assisted in your studies, a task I bore.
        I was there from the start, your partner in crime,
        Now it's all about you, as we lost track of time.
        
        I was there from the start, in every way,
        But it's all about you now, in the light of the day.
        I pondered your attachments, your intent so bold , when you were at home.
        Was it all a game, a story left untold?

        A simple "sorry" offered, yet it didn't sweep the fray.
        For a month, I inquired, sought the words to mend the break,
        But "sorry" alone couldn't heal the heartache.
        
        My projects and exams, they took a hit,
        The turmoil that followed, I'll never forget it.
        Despite the chaos, I stood strong and tall,
        the final day  result came, leaving me feeling low.
        
        I reached out, seeking a bit of empathy,
        Asking, "How am I?" in my moments of vulnerability.
        Hours passed, you were absent, distant and cold,
        But you were ready for a heated argument, when u came.
        
        You declared your actions were right of the starting and you were lying for years, and I was in disbelief,
        A web of lies unraveling, causing endless grief.
        No longer willing to listen, the silence took its toll,
        I had to find my voice, express what was in my soul.
        
        You shared that screenshoot with your sister, it seems,
        Twisting the narrative, altering the themes.
        You speak of respect, a charge unjust,
        For all I've given you, for love and trust and what not.
        
        Even when I wasn't by your side, I'd strive,
        To be there when you needed, to keep our love alive.
        Through the highs and lows, I'd stand with you,
        A love so deep, pure, and true.

        You'd compare me to your father, an endless refrain,
        "He's your father," you'd say, causing me pain.
        I am who I am, I did all I could,
        What's left, I'm unsure, but it's understood.'
        
        We had a fight where parents would intrude,
        Was it a plan to ignore ma, and finish everything?
        You changed your about me, neglected me in the fray,
        "But it's not over until I win, I must convey" u wrote.
        I dont know what you wanted to win, from whom u say u are my life and what respect i haven't give you.
        
        While I waited for a response, so delayed,
        I'd fight for you with "Ma," but no disrespect allowed for them.
        I'd said countless times, "I'll take it on me, don't you see?"
        But you ignored "Ma," said your actions were right, carefree.
        
        You're marked by "low thinking," before results, it seems,
        "Quickly do your UPSC, cannt live like that without you" you'd say, in your streams.
        I replied to your status that if posible let your parents know about us,as a joke, i dont know whats wrong in it.
        
        your dreams ,At home, you will teach online, and research,
        Planning for adoption, dreams of family so bright.
        Your pay would go to that family, you'd avow,
        But the results arrived, and you have a different vow.
        and there you not even needed me, well

        Coming home bi-weekly, a routine that you knew,
        Those family bonds, from ma to aunty, what happened to?
        A sudden shift, a change that left me in doubt,
        Why that Facebook request when I was fine without?, i regret that decesion.
        
        Your stance seems to waver, it shifts and transforms,
        You said, "Don't change," but look at you.
        You lied about our truth, it's a painful mire,
        Deception and doubt, you've lit the liar's fire.
        
        You're still fixated on "boys," it's your song,
        From the very start to the end, it's what you prolong.
        You lied to your sister, a well-orchestrated scheme like nothing happened for years other than this,
        Telling her wrong, disrupting everything.

        You sit,chat-pat, study with them, have friends and more,
        I thought I could trust you, in this intricate embrace.
        But boundaries exist, you crossed them time to time in a relation,
        In the beginning, perhaps, but it's a different paradigm.
        
        No justifications required, just some regret and a new start,
        Yet you clung to the past, refusing to depart.
        I didn't need such openness, just someone by my side,
        Told you countless times, "Leave or let our love abide."
        
        For you, those things seemed more important, it appears,
        Than me, our relation, and the dreams of yesteryears.
        Your mindset remains fixed, in that I'm no longer vested,
        I've moved beyond, it's time I requested.

        Why were you with me if you desired such space?
        I gave all I had, trying to keep our love in place.
        But it seems you don't need me, the bond we once knew,
        The relation, the family, for you, they no longer hold true.

        I gave my everthing, trusted you with my life.
        Fought with everyone for you, and dont even trusted me, this condition, that condition?
        Why me to use u knew i loved you, never thought of me what kind of love was that?
        after years n years, u just gone by saying i tried,
        dont u have feelings?
        
        What kind of person have you become, I wonder,
        To use me, emotionally, physically, sexually, mentally like thunder.
        You've played your game well, but at what cost?
        Karma will reveal what's truly lost.


        Now, as we conclude this convoluted ride,
        I hope you find peace on the other side.
        Congrats you played well with me.
